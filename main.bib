	abstract = {We present a method to analyze daily activities, such as meal preparation, using video from an egocentric camera. Our method performs inference about activities, actions, hands, and objects. Daily activities are a challenging domain for activity recognition which are well-suited to an egocentric approach. In contrast to previous activity recognition methods, our approach does not require pre-trained detectors for objects and hands. Instead we demonstrate the ability to learn a hierarchical model of an activity by exploiting the consistent appearance of objects, hands, and actions that results from the egocentric context. We show that joint modeling of activities, actions, and objects leads to superior performance in comparison to the case where they are considered independently. We introduce a novel representation of actions based on object-hand interactions and experimentally demonstrate the superior performance of our representation in comparison to standard activity representations such as bag of words.},

The result is a fully self-contained system that we call GlaciAR (Glass-enabled Contextual Interactions for Augmented Reality). It operates by extracting contextual interactions from observing users performing actions. GlaciAR is able to i) automatically determine moments of relevance based on a head motion attention model, ii) automatically produce video guidance information, iii) trigger these guides based on an object detection method, iv) learn without supervision from observing multiple users and v) operate fully on-board a current eyewear computer (Google Glass). We describe the components of GlaciAR together with user evaluations on three tasks. We see this work as a first step toward scaling up the notoriously difficult authoring problem in guidance systems and an exploration of enhancing user natural abilities via minimally invasive visual cues.},

	abstract = {Wearable cameras allow people to record their daily activities from a user-centered (First Person Vision) perspective. Due to their favorable location, wearable cameras frequently capture the hands of the user, and may thus represent a promising user-machine interaction tool for different applications. Existent First Person Vision methods handle hand segmentation as a background-foreground problem, ignoring two important facts: i) hands are not a single "skin-like" moving element, but a pair of interacting cooperative entities, ii) close hand interactions may lead to hand-to-hand occlusions and, as a consequence, create a single hand-like segment. These facts complicate a proper understanding of hand movements and interactions. Our approach extends traditional background-foreground strategies, by including a hand-identification step (left-right) based on a Maxwell distribution of angle and position. Hand-to-hand occlusions are addressed by exploiting temporal superpixels. The experimental results show that, in addition to a reliable left/right hand-segmentation, our approach considerably improves the traditional background-foreground hand-segmentation.},
